The inventors of different technological methods along with the users of the technology and other stakeholders get together in standard setting organizations to select particular methods for common use. The standards developed in standard setting organizations are acting as an input for further inventive activity, resulting in the development of products and new technologies implementing the selected standard.  </p>
